# Car-prices-Scraping-from-autoscout.de

This project shows a systematic way, using the Python programming language, to scrape car price data from one of the most common online car intermediaries in Germany: autoscout24.de. For this purpose, a collection of libraries is being used, such as BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, and IPython. Such a project gives the ability to quickly collect hundreds of rows of data that can significantly help with understanding the car marketplace in Germany.
